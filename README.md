# CSOAResults

This repository contains the code used to generate the results from the CSOA 
paper. It is structured as follows:

- The `generate_seurats` file contains the code used to generate the Seurat
objects on which the gene set analysis methods were run.
- The `gene_sets_breast`, `gene_sets_lung` and `gene_sets_panc` files contain
the code used to create gene sets for each dataset.
